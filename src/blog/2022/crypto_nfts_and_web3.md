# Crypto, Nfts and Web3
The idea behind crypto, a more open internet with permanent records and financial independence. Sounds great right? Well... It does and Cryptocurrency promise to deliver that today.


**If only they weren't so darn problematic.**

## Electricity and Climate impact 
You see, Most cryptocurrency today are based on a concept called "Proof Of Work". Which is a very [inefficient](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html) way of comitting transactions to a blockchain
(*A Blockchain is a list of receipts for transactions done in crypto*)
Using a lot of power, technically doesn't have to hurt the climate if its ran on clean energy but sadly most of it is not.

## So, What makes Crypto worth it?
Cryptocurrency are used as a less regulated form of investing. You buy some coin and sell when you want. Cause the currencies are so volatile there's some real good money to be made.

NFTS and Web3 (*Please stop calling it that*) on the other hand use individual coins (Tokens) to be able to create something called a **Smart Contract**

*"Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. 
They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome"* Source: IBM

Sounds great right? Contracts that cannot be broken! I'll never be scammed online ever again!! Well, people [purposefully](https://technode.com/2020/07/10/chinese-police-bust-14-million-smart-contracts-scam/) put [bugs](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/hackers-drain-31-million-from-cryptocurrency-service-monox-finance/) in their [smart](https://jeiwan.net/posts/flashloan-scam/) [contracts](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/ferreira) that are [hard to notice](https://tij.me/blog/scamming-people-via-ethereum-smart-contracts/) if you're not a software developer.

## So what do NFT's have to do with this?
First, lets define what a NFT ("Non-fungible token") really is.

It's a token, That cannot be [fungled](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Fungling). (Ok funny joke done)

"Non-fungible" means that every token is one-of-a-kind and unique (Just like you <3). This is what allows them to be traded and valued independently (With bitcoin, every coin is worth the same)


NFT's are made possible by these smart contracts, They're used to transfer them and verify ownership of a "token".
The smart contract then "links" the token to some data on the internet, this can be a link to a [tweet](https://opensea.io/collection/tweets), [artwork](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/72849032533962044181899916662165598235188374386140962593886963003460713185281) or even [nothing at all](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs)

## It's time to bring up the Ether.
[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) is one of many Cryptocurrency. It has its own blockchain which many other cryptocurrency are based on (Doge, Shibe, [and many many more](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/views/all/))
NFT's, Smart Contracts and all of the above apply to Ethereum. It's THE currency for building the cool new things it allows.


Now, if only it wasn't
- Based on "Proof Of Work" (for now)
- Prone to fraud and scamming
- [Not in a very stable place](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/02/the-collapse-of-eth-is-inevitable)


And that's where the problem with cryptocurrency lie. They're a great idea, executed poorly and misused for scamming and fraud. We have the tools to create systems like Ingame Items that you can sell (Look at CSGO with the Steam Market). 
The only problem is that that's centralized and black-boxed by Valve in their datacenters.


NFT's in paticular have no real purpose other than to be used to distract from scams

### "They help artists!"
- [Thats](https://futurism.com/the-byte/artist-stealing-nfts) [What](https://hyperallergic.com/702309/artists-say-plagiarized-nfts-are-plaguing-their-community/) [They](https://hyperallergic.com/702309/artists-say-plagiarized-nfts-are-plaguing-their-community/) [Want](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vxe7/people-are-stealing-art-and-turning-it-into-nfts) [You](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nft-fraud-qinni-art) [To](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/art-theft-nfts) [Think](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/todd-kramer-nft-theft-1234614874/).

### "You can get richt from them!"
- Only if you get in on top, Which the ship has sailed for
- NFT's are often paired with promises of riches when you re-sell that NFT that no-one wants cause the previous owner sold it to himself a couple times to make you think it's hot
- Seems to rely HEAVILY on "Hype" to make it worth something
- [Just like any other online account, Can be lost within seconds](https://web.archive.org/web/20211230071313/https://twitter.com/toddkramer1/status/1476450669406175234)

 
**If you're not a influencer or investor, Good luck making a profit on NFT's**

## You haven't said the 3rd term of the title yet?? What about Web3???
So basically, [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) is a term coined by crypto enthusiasts to give a name to the ecosystem around Crypto applications ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/)) but it's kind of [difficult](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+on+web3) to figure out how to get there or what the benefit is.
From what i've been able to gather, They want to make the Web a financial powerhouse. Pay 0.05 ETH to finish reading this article. And that goes against what I want the web to be.


**Our current systems work, They're far from perfect but they work. I'm all for better public record, keeping data from getting lost and true online freedoms. But sadly, Crypto is not the way to achieve this goal.**
