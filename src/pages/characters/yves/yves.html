        <h1>Yves</h1>
        It/It - Synthetic Rodent<br><br>

        Yves is a small synthetic rodent that lives in a datacenter, It's made of a highly durable rubber that can squeeze between hard drives and other tight spaces.<br><br>
        Whenever Yves isn't in need it gets comfortable and sleeps between the wires.<br>
        While it sleeps, it curiously browses the files and databases on the servers.
