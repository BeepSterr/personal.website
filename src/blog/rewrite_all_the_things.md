Soo, Been a while huh!

I've slowly been working on a new generator for this site, 
and in turn a new site for this site. (lol)

## Twitch
I've gotten back into twitch streaming, Imma stream at least once a week (sundays) but try to every other day. I'm mainly playing TF2 and Minecraft

## Bad stuff in the old site
- Required a JS file for every page. (which is a lot of js)
- Was a mess to maintain
- did not do cool stuff:tm:
- was not fun to work on

## Why the new site is better!
- JS Files are now optional âœ¨
- JS metadata can be set per folder
- Can do cool stuff:tm: (Like generate thumbnails, compress video!)
- Is using some tailwind for stuff
- Better development server & debugging

### What's next?
- Fix tailwind in my IDE not showing up on most pages
- Re-add sitemap generation
- Re-add the characters pages (with proper crediting)


I've had a blast working on this "2.0" version of my website and I hope I can keep it up going into the next year
