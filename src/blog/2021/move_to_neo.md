# The move to Neo(cities)
So, my previous "website" was a [Notion](https://notion.so) note,
Which works really well for generic content.
anyway, this shit is way cooler **cause i fucking love old ass webdesign**
screw the rules!!! make it look sick as FUCK!!

also, a good excuse to shoddily put together a [static site generator](https://github.com/beepsdev/personal.website)
still has some issues, like the [sitemap](/sitemap.html) being one deploy behind

but hey at least it has auto-build and cool templates, 
like for example what OS this was built on 
its {{generator.platform}} {{generator.arch}} at {{generator.timestamp}} btw
